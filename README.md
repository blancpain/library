# Key Takeaways

Dipped my toes in OOP and linking objects to DOM elements with this project. The goal was to exlore different ways to structure my JS code and to implement some abstractions. I am still not 100% comfortable with using objects but this was a good intro project and looking to build on this going forward.

The project also allowed me to practice my CSS skills and in particular CSS Grid.
